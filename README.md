# Summary

Italian-Old is a treebank containing **Dante Alighieri's Comedy**, based on the 1994 Petrocchi edition and taken from the [**DanteSearch corpus**](https://dantesearch.dantenetwork.it), originally created at the University of Pisa, Italy. The syntactic annotation has been done from scratch, following UD annotation scheme.

It is a treebank of Old Italian, specifically Florentine. The Comedy was composed between approximately 1306 and 1321.

# Introduction

This treebank includes 3 419 sentences (122 038 syntactic words) and is a literary text (poetry). It is divided into three sections, known as Cantiche: Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso. Specifically, Inferno includes 1 228 sentences and 41 368 syntactic words; Purgatorio consists of 1 174 sentences and 41 277 syntactic words; while Paradiso contains 1 017 sentences and 39 393 syntactic words.

The treebank is split into three subsets, `dev`, `test` and `train`, with approximate ratios of 10%, 10%, and 80%, respectively, for Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso. These subsets are then merged into unique `dev`, `test` and `train` sets.

The distribution of Inferno (tokens: 41 368) with respect to the subsets is as follows:
* `train`: 1002 sentences (OldItalian_Dante_Inferno-1; OldItalian_Dante_Inferno-1002) - 33104 tokens
* `dev`: 107 sentences (OldItalian_Dante_Inferno-1003; OldItalian_Dante_Inferno-1109) - 4136 tokens
* `test`: 119 sentences (OldItalian_Dante_Inferno-1110; OldItalian_Dante_Inferno-1228) - 4128 tokens

The distribution of Purgatorio (tokens: 41 277) with respect to the subsets is as follows:
* `train`: 958 sentences (OldItalian_Dante_Purgatorio-1; OldItalian_Dante_Purgatorio-958) - 33031 tokens
* `dev`: 100 sentences (OldItalian_Dante_Purgatorio-959; OldItalian_Dante_Purgatorio-1058) - 4130 tokens
* `test`: 116 sentences (OldItalian_Dante_Purgatorio-1059; OldItalian_Dante_Purgatorio-1174) - 4116 tokens

The distribution of Paradiso (tokens: 39 393) with respect to the subsets is as follows:
* `train`: 814 sentences (OldItalian_Dante_Paradiso-1; OldItalian_Dante_Paradiso-814) - 31546 tokens
* `dev`: 101 sentences (OldItalian_Dante_Paradiso-815; OldItalian_Dante_Paradiso-915) - 3951 tokens
* `test`: 102 sentences (OldItalian_Dante_Paradiso-916; OldItalian_Dante_Paradiso-1017) - 3896 tokens

**!!  Italian-Old treebank is still under revision to check for mistakes and inconsistencies throughout the annotation of the Cantiche; therefore, its structure is subject to change.**
